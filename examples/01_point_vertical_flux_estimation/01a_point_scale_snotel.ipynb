    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates the point-scale modeling workflow in **CONFLUENCE**, a framework for reproducible and modular computational hydrology. At the point scale, we simulate vertical energy and water fluxes at a single site, independent of routing or lateral flow, to isolate and evaluate model process representations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we focus on the **Paradise SNOTEL station (ID 602)**, located at 1,630 m elevation in Washington’s Cascade Range. This site represents a transitional snow climate and provides long-term observations of snow water equivalent (SWE) and soil moisture across multiple depths. By reproducing the observed seasonal snow and soil moisture dynamics, this tutorial demonstrates how CONFLUENCE structures a controlled, transparent, and fully reproducible point-scale experiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through this example, you will see how configuration-driven workflows manage experiment setup, geospatial definition, input data preprocessing, model instantiation, and performance evaluation—building a foundation for more complex distributed modeling studies later in the series.\n"

    "# Tutorial Summary and Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary: Point-Scale Snow and Soil Process Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial demonstrated the complete CONFLUENCE workflow for point-scale hydrological modeling, establishing fundamental principles for reproducible computational hydrology research. Through the Paradise SNOTEL case study, we illustrated how standardized workflows can bridge the gap between complex modeling frameworks and practical scientific applications while maintaining scientific rigor and reproducibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Methods\n",
    "The tutorial successfully demonstrated CONFLUENCE's core capabilities through five integrated workflow components. Reproducible workflow management was achieved through configuration-driven experiments that provide complete provenance tracking and ensure experimental transparency. The model-agnostic preprocessing pipeline creates standardized data products that enable true model physics comparisons by separating data preparation from model-specific requirements. Process-based simulation was implemented using SUMMA's modular physics to explicitly represent energy and water balance processes at the point scale. Multi-variable validation leveraged co-located snow water equivalent and multi-depth soil moisture observations to provide comprehensive model evaluation. Finally, scientific interpretation linked quantitative performance metrics to underlying physical processes, moving beyond statistical assessment to process understanding.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scientific Process Validation\n",
    "The tutorial validated key hydrological processes across multiple temporal scales and physical domains. Snow physics evaluation included accumulation, metamorphism, and energy-balance driven melt processes, with assessment of both magnitude and timing accuracy. Soil hydrology validation examined multi-depth moisture dynamics and vertical water redistribution through four soil layers, testing infiltration and drainage representations. Energy balance processes were implicitly evaluated through successful simulation of temperature-driven phase changes and moisture dynamics. Temporal dynamics were assessed from daily to seasonal time scales, capturing both rapid response and longer-term memory effects. Physical realism was maintained through mass and energy conservation checks and realistic state variable bounds.\n",
    "\n",
    "### CONFLUENCE Framework Demonstration\n",
    "This tutorial showcased CONFLUENCE's modular architecture through specialized managers that handle distinct workflow components while maintaining system integration. Workflow orchestration capabilities were demonstrated through automated step sequencing. The scalable design principle was established, showing how the same framework structure supports applications from point-scale studies through continental-scale analyses. Research continuity was ensured by creating a foundation that directly enables progression to distributed modeling and large-sample comparative studies in subsequent tutorials.\n",
