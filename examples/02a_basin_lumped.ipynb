    "# CONFLUENCE Tutorial - 3: Lumped Basin Workflow (Bow River at Banff)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial shows how to scale up from point-scale modeling to basin-scale streamflow simulation using CONFLUENCE. Building on our previous tutorials with SNOTEL and FLUXNET data, we now demonstrate how to model an entire watershed as a single unit to generate streamflow at the basin outlet.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Lumped Basin Modeling?\n",
    "\n",
    "Lumped basin modeling treats the entire watershed as one homogeneous unit, averaging all the spatial variability across the catchment. While this is a simplification, it's a valuable approach because:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Simplicity**: Easier to understand and implement than distributed models\n",
    "- **Computational efficiency**: Fast execution makes it ideal for calibration and uncertainty analysis  \n",
    "- **Baseline performance**: Establishes whether a model can capture the basic watershed response before adding spatial complexity\n",
    "- **Parameter identification**: Simpler structure makes it easier to understand which parameters control model behavior\n",
    "\n",
    "### Case Study: Bow River at Banff\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll use the Bow River at Banff as our example watershed:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Location**: Canadian Rockies, Alberta, Canada\n",
    "- **Drainage area**: ~2,210 km¬≤\n",
    "- **Elevation**: Ranges from 1,384 m at the outlet to over 3,400 m in the headwaters\n",
    "- **Climate**: Snow-dominated mountain system with pronounced seasonal cycles\n",
    "- **Gauging station**: Water Survey of Canada station 05BB001 with long-term observations\n",
    "\n",
    "This watershed presents interesting modeling challenges:\n",
    "- Strong elevation gradients affecting temperature and precipitation\n",
    "- Complex snow dynamics across elevation zones\n",
    "- Seasonal storage in snowpack and glaciers\n",
    "- Pronounced spring freshet from snowmelt\n",
    "\n",
    "### What You'll Learn\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial will teach you how to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Set up a basin-scale project** with CONFLUENCE's automated workflow\n",
    "2. **Delineate watersheds** automatically from digital elevation models\n",
    "3. **Aggregate spatial data** to create catchment-averaged characteristics\n",
    "4. **Process meteorological forcing** data for basin-scale modeling\n",
    "5. **Configure and run SUMMA** for lumped basin simulation\n",
    "6. **Evaluate model performance** using standard hydrological metrics\n",
    "7. **Interpret results** and understand model limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tutorial Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll walk through the complete CONFLUENCE workflow step by step:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Project Setup**: Create the organized directory structure\n",
    "2. **Watershed Delineation**: Automatically identify the watershed boundary\n",
    "3. **Data Acquisition**: Get elevation, soil, and land cover data\n",
    "4. **Forcing Data**: Process meteorological inputs\n",
    "5. **Model Configuration**: Set up SUMMA for the lumped basin\n",
    "6. **Model Execution**: Run the simulation\n",
    "7. **Results Analysis**: Compare simulated and observed streamflow\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this tutorial, you'll understand how CONFLUENCE handles the transition from point-scale to basin-scale modeling and be ready to explore more complex distributed modeling approaches."

    "Building on the point-scale modeling expertise from Tutorials 01a and 01b, we now advance to basin-scale hydrological modeling. This represents a fundamental scaling transition: from process validation at individual sites to integrated watershed simulation that captures the collective hydrological response of an entire catchment.\n",

    "- Spatial Scale: Single location ‚Üí Entire watershed (~2,210 km¬≤)\n",
