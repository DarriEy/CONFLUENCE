    "# CONFLUENCE Tutorial - 10: CAMELS Large Sample Study (Multi-Basin Streamflow Analysis)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial represents the culmination of our CONFLUENCE large sample studies series: systematic streamflow modeling across hundreds of watersheds using the CAMELS spat dataset (Knoben et al., 2025). While our previous large sample tutorials focused on point-scale processes (FLUXNET energy fluxes, NorSWE snow dynamics), this tutorial demonstrates watershed-scale analysis of the most fundamental hydrological variable: streamflow. This represents the classic application of hydrological modeling and the ultimate test of CONFLUENCE's capabilities across diverse watersheds.\n",
