    "# CONFLUENCE Tutorial - 1: Point-Scale Workflow (SNOTEL Example)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Scientific Importance of Point-Scale Modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "Point-scale modeling represents the fundamental building block of distributed hydrological modeling, where vertical energy and water balance processes are simulated at a single location without the complexities of lateral flow routing. This approach is scientifically valuable for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Process Understanding**: Point-scale simulations isolate vertical processes (precipitation, evapotranspiration, snowmelt, infiltration, and soil moisture dynamics), allowing researchers to evaluate model physics without confounding effects from spatial heterogeneity and routing processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Model Validation**: Single-point simulations provide controlled conditions for testing model assumptions and parameter sensitivity, serving as a prerequisite for successful distributed modeling applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Observational Constraints**: Point-scale modeling leverages high-quality, long-term observational datasets to constrain model parameters and validate process representations before scaling to larger, distributed domains.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Case Study: Paradise SNOTEL Station\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial demonstrates  point-scale simulations in CONFLUENCE using the Paradise SNOTEL station (ID: 602) in Washington State. Located at 1,630 m elevation in the Cascade Range, this site represents a transitional snow climate with observations of both Snow Water Equivilalent (SWE) and Soil Moisture (SM) at four depths.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this tutorial, you will:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Understand CONFLUENCE architecture**: Learn how the modular framework manages complex hydrological modeling workflows\n",
    "2. **Configure point-scale simulations**: Set up CONFLUENCE for single-point SUMMA simulations with minimal spatial complexity\n",
    "3. **Evaluate model performance**: Compare simulated and observed snow water equivalent and soil moisture using quantitative metrics\n",
    "4. **Interpret results scientifically**: Analyze model-observation discrepancies in the context of process representation and parameter uncertainty\n",
    "5. **Assess workflow efficiency**: Experience CONFLUENCE's automated workflow management and reproducible modeling practices\n",
    "\n",
    "This foundation in point-scale modeling prepares you for more complex distributed modeling applications while building confidence in model physics and parameter estimation approaches."

    "# Step 1: Experiment Initialization and Reproducible Workflow Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scientific Context\n",
    "Reproducible hydrological research requires systematic organization of data, code, and results. Modern computational hydrology faces several challenges:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Provenance Tracking: Understanding how results were generated, which data were used, and what decisions were made\n",
    "- Experiment Scaling: Moving from single-site studies to large sample investigations across hundreds of watersheds\n",
    "- Collaborative Research: Enabling multiple researchers to build upon previous work\n",
    "- Long-term Maintenance: Ensuring experiments remain accessible and reproducible years later\n",
    "\n",
    "Point-scale modeling serves as the foundation for larger distributed studies. The organizational principles established here directly enable the large-sample hydrological studies we'll explore in Tutorial 4, where these same workflows scale across hundreds of SNOTEL sites simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "## CONFLUENCE Implementation\n",
    "CONFLUENCE addresses reproducibility through three core principles:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Configuration-Driven Workflows: All experiment settings are stored in human-readable YAML files that serve as complete experiment documentation\n",
    "- Standardized Directory Structure: Consistent organization enables automated processing and easy navigation across studies\n",
    "- Modular Architecture: Specialized managers handle different workflow components, making the system maintainable and extensible\n",
    "\n",
    "The framework automatically creates detailed logs, maintains data provenance, and ensures that any experiment can be reproduced from its configuration file alone."
