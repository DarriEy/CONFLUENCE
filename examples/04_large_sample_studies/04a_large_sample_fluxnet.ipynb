    "# CONFLUENCE Tutorial - 8: Large Sample Studies (FLUXNET Multi-Site Analysis)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial represents the culmination of our CONFLUENCE series, demonstrating the evolution from single-domain modeling to large sample studies. While previous tutorials focused on modeling individual domains across different scales, large sample studies leverage CONFLUENCE's workflow efficiency to systematically analyze hundreds or thousands of sites, enabling comparative hydrology and robust statistical analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Large Sample Studies in Hydrology\n",
    "\n",
    "Large sample studies in hydrology involve systematic analysis across many sites, watersheds, or regions to identify patterns in hydrological processes across different environments, test theoretical concepts under diverse conditions, and develop improved model parameterizations based on multi-site evidence. This approach enables researchers to quantify uncertainty, assess model performance and reliability across different settings, and advance comparative hydrology by comparing hydrological responses across climates, landscapes, and scales.\n",
    "\n",
    "### FLUXNET as a Framework for Large Sample Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "The FLUXNET network provides an ideal framework for large sample hydrological analysis due to its global coverage spanning all continents and diverse ecosystems including forests, grasslands, wetlands, and croplands across multiple climate zones from tropical to boreal and arid regions. The network's standardized eddy covariance methodology ensures consistent, quality-controlled data processing with comparable variables across sites at standardized temporal resolution.\n",
    "\n",
    "FLUXNET data offers significant scientific value for energy balance validation of land surface models, ecosystem-scale process understanding, climate-vegetation interaction studies, and model benchmarking across diverse environmental conditions. This makes it particularly well-suited for systematic multi-site hydrological analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### CONFLUENCE's Large Sample Capabilities\n",
    "\n",
    "CONFLUENCE's design makes it particularly effective for large sample analysis through workflow automation that reduces manual effort per site while maintaining consistent methodology across all sites to ensure comparability. The system's template-based configuration enables rapid site setup, while complete workflow documentation ensures reproducible science. High-performance computing capabilities allow parallel execution across multiple sites, and standardized output formats facilitate multi-site analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Technical Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "Large sample studies with CONFLUENCE involve several key components: strategic site selection across environmental gradients, automated configuration generation for site-specific setups, efficient batch processing of CONFLUENCE across multiple sites, systematic results aggregation and standardization from all sites, and comprehensive comparative analysis to identify patterns and relationships across sites.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial will teach you to design large sample experiments with appropriate site selection strategies, automate configuration generation for hundreds of sites, manage batch processing of multiple CONFLUENCE runs, aggregate and analyze results from multi-site experiments, visualize patterns across environmental gradients, and apply statistical methods to understand hydrological controls.\n",
    "\n",
    "The combination of CONFLUENCE's workflow efficiency with large sample methodologies opens new possibilities for understanding how hydrological processes vary across Earth's diverse environments, from individual flux towers to global patterns."

    "## Step 1: Large Sample Template Configuration and Experimental Design\n",
    "This tutorial represents the next evolution in our CONFLUENCE series: large sample studies. Rather than scaling to larger spatial domains, we now leverage CONFLUENCE's workflow efficiency to systematically analyze hundreds of sites across global environmental gradients. Using the FLUXNET network, we demonstrate how to transform CONFLUENCE from a single-domain modeling platform into a powerful engine for comparative hydrology and statistical analysis across diverse ecosystems.\n",
    "\n",
    "The same CONFLUENCE framework now scales to handle systematic multi-site analysis while maintaining the workflow consistency and scientific rigor established throughout our tutorial series.\n"

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial demonstrated the scaling capabilies of CONFLUENCE, transitioning from single-domain modeling to large sample comparative hydrology. Using the global FLUXNET network as our example, we explored how CONFLUENCE's workflow efficiency enables systematic analysis across hundreds of sites with diverse environmental conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The tutorial progressed through three key phases: comprehensive analysis of the FLUXNET dataset to understand its global coverage and environmental diversity; automated configuration generation and batch processing using the `run_watersheds_fluxnet.py` script to execute CONFLUENCE across multiple sites simultaneously; and multi-site output analysis to extract, compare, and validate evapotranspiration results across environmental gradients.\n",
    "\n",
    "This large sample approach represents a fundamental advancement in hydrological modeling, moving beyond site-specific case studies to enable robust statistical analysis, pattern recognition, and process understanding at unprecedented scales. The combination of CONFLUENCE's standardized workflow with large sample methodologies opens new possibilities for comparative hydrology, allowing researchers to distinguish universal hydrological processes from site-specific effects and evaluate model transferability across diverse climatic and ecological conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The systematic processing of FLUXNET sites demonstrates how modern computational infrastructure and standardized modeling workflows can transform our understanding of hydrological processes from local observations to global patterns, advancing both theoretical understanding and practical applications in water resources management and climate science.\n",
