    "# CONFLUENCE Tutorial - 5: Elevation-Based HRU Discretization (Bow River at Banff)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "This tutorial demonstrates the most spatially detailed modeling approach in our basin-scale series through elevation-based HRU discretization. Building on the semi-distributed model from Tutorial 02b, we now further subdivide each GRU into multiple Hydrologic Response Units (HRUs) based on elevation bands, capturing the strong elevation controls on mountain hydrology while maintaining computational tractability and scientific interpretability.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Elevation-Based Discretization Philosophy\n",
    "Elevation-based discretization creates multiple HRUs within each GRU by systematically dividing the elevation range into altitudinal bands, typically using consistent vertical intervals such as 200-meter increments. This approach addresses within-GRU heterogeneity by recognizing that areas at different elevations experience fundamentally different climate conditions and hydrological processes, even within the same sub-basin. The methodology achieves maximum spatial detail while maintaining computational efficiency through strategic aggregation of small areas, and explicitly represents elevation-dependent processes including temperature lapse rates and snow dynamics that are critical in mountain environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scientific Concepts and Implementation\n",
    "The elevation band concept organizes landscape areas into systematic altitude ranges that group locations with similar elevation-dependent characteristics, ensuring that each band captures relatively uniform thermal and precipitation regimes. Hydrologic Response Units represent the finest computational scale in this framework, defined by the intersection of spatial location (GRU boundaries) and elevation characteristics (altitudinal bands), creating spatially-explicit process representation. The elevation band size parameter controls the vertical resolution of the model, with smaller intervals capturing finer elevation gradients at the cost of increased computational demands, while larger intervals reduce detail but maintain efficiency. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Scientific Rationale \n",
    "In mountain watersheds such as the Bow River system, elevation serves as the primary control on hydrological processes through systematic temperature gradients that create elevation-dependent energy balances affecting snowmelt timing and evapotranspiration rates. Precipitation patterns exhibit strong orographic effects that produce elevation-dependent gradients in both rainfall and snowfall amounts and timing. Snow dynamics vary dramatically with elevation through accumulation patterns, persistence duration, and ablation timing that create distinct seasonal water storage and release patterns. Vegetation zonation reflects elevation-dependent growing conditions that affect interception, transpiration, and land surface energy exchange processes. Seasonal timing variations manifest through earlier snowmelt and growing seasons at lower elevations contrasting with extended snow cover and delayed spring onset at higher elevations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives and Technical Implementation\n",
    "Through this tutorial, you will master the application of elevation-based discretization to existing GRU boundaries, understand the configuration of elevation parameters including band size and minimum HRU size specifications, develop skills in managing increased model complexity with dozens of HRUs while maintaining computational efficiency, learn to interpret elevation-dependent results across different altitudinal zones, understand computational trade-offs between spatial detail and processing efficiency, and develop capabilities for analyzing spatial patterns in distributed model outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The technical implementation integrates automated elevation analysis within existing GRU boundaries to identify optimal band configurations, systematic HRU creation through intersection of elevation bands with validated sub-basin boundaries, comprehensive attribute calculation for elevation-dependent characteristics including climate adjustments and vegetation parameters, network connectivity preservation that maintains routing topology while accommodating increased spatial detail, and quality assurance protocols that ensure computational stability and physical realism across all elevation bands.\n",
    "\n",
    "This elevation-based approach represents the culmination of our basin-scale modeling progression, providing the most detailed spatial representation while building directly on the validated GRU structure from Tutorial 02b. The resulting model captures the essential elevation-dependent processes that drive mountain hydrology while maintaining the computational efficiency necessary for practical applications in water resources management and climate impact assessment."

    "## Step 1: Elevation-Based Setup with Data Reuse\n",
    "Building on the semi-distributed modeling from Tutorial 02b, we now advance to the most spatially detailed approach: elevation-based HRU discretization. This represents the pinnacle of spatial complexity in our modeling series, subdividing each GRU into multiple elevation bands to capture the strong altitudinal controls on mountain hydrology while maintaining computational tractability.\n",
    "\n",
    "The same CONFLUENCE framework seamlessly handles this complexity increase while intelligent data reuse from Tutorial 02b eliminates redundant preprocessing, demonstrating efficient workflow management for the most detailed spatial modeling approach.\n"

    "## Summary: Elevation-Based HRU Discretization\n",
    "This tutorial successfully demonstrated the most spatially detailed basin-scale modeling approach by implementing elevation-based HRU discretization using CONFLUENCE. Through the enhanced Bow River at Banff case study, we illustrated how the same standardized workflow framework seamlessly scales from semi-distributed GRUs to elevation-stratified HRUs while capturing critical altitudinal controls on mountain hydrology, representing the pinnacle of spatial detail in our basin-scale modeling progression.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Methodological Achievements\n",
    "The tutorial established elevation-stratified spatial discretization through systematic subdivision of validated GRU boundaries into altitudinal bands that capture elevation-dependent process variations while maintaining computational efficiency. Mountain hydrology process representation was achieved through explicit incorporation of temperature lapse rates, snow zone dynamics, and elevation-dependent precipitation gradients that drive seasonal water storage and release patterns. Intelligent spatial scaling management was demonstrated through strategic HRU aggregation using minimum size thresholds and elevation band optimization that balances spatial detail with computational traceability.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scientific Process Understanding\n",
    "The evaluation demonstrated CONFLUENCE's capability to simulate elevation-dependent hydrological processes through detailed representation of snow accumulation and ablation timing across altitudinal gradients, temperature-driven energy balance variations, and elevation-specific vegetation dynamics. Seasonal process attribution was achieved through quantification of individual elevation band contributions to streamflow, revealing the relative importance of different altitudinal zones in watershed response. Mountain watershed complexity was successfully captured through integration of elevation effects with spatial routing, demonstrating realistic representation of snowline migration, thermal stratification, and orographic precipitation effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Framework Scalability Validation\n",
    "This tutorial confirmed CONFLUENCE's seamless complexity scaling by applying identical workflow principles across the complete spatial hierarchy from lumped through elevation-based modeling without requiring fundamental architectural changes. The model-agnostic preprocessing approach proved equally effective for elevation-stratified spatial processing and multi-HRU routing configuration, reinforcing the framework's broad applicability across modeling scales. Computational efficiency optimization was demonstrated through intelligent data reuse, strategic HRU management, and workflow orchestration that maintains performance while enabling the most detailed spatial representation in our basin-scale series.\n",
    "\n",
    "This culmination of basin-scale modeling complexity establishes comprehensive principles for elevation-dependent process representation and prepares for the regional-scale and large-sample modeling approaches in subsequent tutorials that will extend these capabilities to multiple watersheds and continental applications.\n",
