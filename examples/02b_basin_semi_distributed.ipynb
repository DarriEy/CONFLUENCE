    "# CONFLUENCE Tutorial - 4: Semi-Distributed Basin Workflow (Bow River at Banff)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "This tutorial demonstrates the next advancement in spatial modeling complexity through semi-distributed basin modeling. Building on the lumped basin approach from Tutorial 02a, we now introduce spatial discretization by dividing the watershed into multiple connected units called Grouped Response Units (GRUs). This approach bridges the gap between simple lumped models and fully distributed representations, offering an optimal balance between computational efficiency and spatial realism.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Semi-Distributed Modeling Philosophy\n",
    "Semi-distributed modeling divides the watershed into multiple sub-basins, with each unit treated as a separate modeling component within a connected network. This approach employs spatial discretization where the watershed is divided into multiple GRUs based on stream network topology, creating connected units where each GRU links to downstream units through a routing network. The methodology represents intermediate complexity that provides more spatial realism than lumped models while maintaining greater simplicity than fully distributed approaches, ensuring computational efficiency with fewer units than fully distributed models while remaining suitable for calibration and uncertainty analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Scientific Concepts\n",
    "The Grouped Response Unit concept represents sub-basins that drain to specific points along the stream network, with each GRU containing similar hydrological characteristics and responding as a unified computational unit. Stream network delineation employs digital elevation models and flow accumulation algorithms to automatically identify stream channels and divide the watershed into connected sub-basins. Routing processes move water from upstream GRUs to downstream GRUs through the stream network while accounting for travel time and channel storage effects. The stream threshold parameter critically controls model complexity by determining how many sub-basins are created, with higher thresholds producing fewer, larger GRUs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scientific Advantages and Applications\n",
    "Semi-distributed modeling captures important spatial variations in climate, topography, and land cover across the watershed while better representing elevation-dependent processes like snow accumulation and temperature gradients. This approach maintains computational efficiency with fewer units than fully distributed models while preserving key spatial patterns, explicitly represents routing dynamics including travel time and attenuation effects in the stream network, and provides diagnostic capabilities that allow examination of contributions from different watershed regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Case Study: Bow River at Banff Semi-Distributed Configuration\n",
    "For this tutorial, we employ the same Bow River watershed from Tutorial 02a but divide it into multiple GRUs through several configuration modifications. The domain method changes from lumped to delineate for watershed subdivision, a stream threshold of 5000 creates multiple sub-basins, mizuRoute provides routing connectivity between GRUs, and spatial complexity increases from single-unit to multi-unit representation. Expected outcomes include better representation of elevation gradients, improved timing of snowmelt contributions, more realistic representation of spatial climate variability, and enhanced ability to diagnose spatial process patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Technical Implementation Framework\n",
    "The semi-distributed approach integrates several key components through automated watershed delineation that identifies sub-basins using flow accumulation algorithms, stream network extraction that creates river network topology connecting the sub-basins, GRU characterization that calculates average characteristics for each sub-basin, routing setup that configures mizuRoute to move water between GRUs, and model integration that couples SUMMA land surface processes with mizuRoute routing capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives and Tutorial Structure\n",
    "Through this tutorial, you will master configuration of semi-distributed models with multiple GRUs, understand control of spatial discretization using stream threshold parameters, comprehend routing processes and their impact on streamflow timing, develop skills in visualizing spatial model structure with GRUs and stream networks, learn to interpret distributed model results and compare with lumped approaches, and manage increased model complexity while maintaining workflow efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial follows the established CONFLUENCE workflow with key modifications for spatial complexity, including project setup initialization for semi-distributed modeling, domain delineation to create multiple sub-basins using stream network analysis, spatial discretization to convert sub-basins to GRUs for modeling, data processing to prepare inputs for multiple modeling units, model configuration to set up coupled SUMMA and mizuRoute systems, model execution to run the integrated land surface and routing model, and comprehensive results analysis comparing semi-distributed versus lumped model performance. By completing this tutorial, you will understand how to add spatial complexity to hydrological models while maintaining computational efficiency, establishing crucial foundations for fully distributed modeling applications."

    "## Summary: Semi-Distributed Basin-Scale Modeling\n",
    "This tutorial successfully demonstrated the advancement from lumped to semi-distributed watershed modeling using CONFLUENCE. Through the enhanced Bow River at Banff case study, we illustrated how the same standardized workflow framework seamlessly scales from single-unit to multi-unit spatial representation while introducing explicit stream network routing and sub-basin connectivity, establishing the foundation for fully distributed hydrological modeling applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Methodological Achievements\n",
    "The tutorial established multi-unit spatial discretization through automated watershed delineation that creates connected sub-basins based on stream network topology and flow accumulation algorithms. Stream network routing integration was successfully implemented through mizuRoute coupling with SUMMA, enabling explicit representation of travel times and channel storage effects between connected GRUs. Intelligent data reuse capabilities were demonstrated through efficient adaptation of geospatial and forcing data from Tutorial 02a, showcasing CONFLUENCE's support for iterative model development and comparative analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scientific Process Understanding\n",
    "The evaluation demonstrated CONFLUENCE's ability to represent spatially-distributed watershed processes through multiple connected sub-basins that capture elevation gradients and heterogeneous runoff generation while maintaining integrated outlet response. Routing dynamics and timing effects were successfully simulated through explicit stream network connectivity that accounts for travel delays and channel storage in streamflow generation. Spatial process attribution capabilities were established through sub-basin-level analysis that enables identification of contributing areas and process patterns across the watershed network.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Framework Scalability Validation\n",
    "This tutorial confirmed CONFLUENCE's seamless complexity scaling by applying identical workflow principles from lumped through semi-distributed modeling without requiring fundamental architectural modifications. The model-agnostic preprocessing approach proved equally effective for multi-GRU spatial processing and routing network configuration, reinforcing the framework's broad applicability across modeling scales. Computational efficiency optimization was demonstrated through intelligent data reuse and workflow management that minimizes redundant processing while enabling rapid exploration of alternative spatial discretization strategies.\n",
    "This foundation in semi-distributed basin modeling establishes essential principles for managing spatial complexity and network connectivity while preparing for the fully distributed modeling approaches and large-scale applications in subsequent tutorials.\n",
