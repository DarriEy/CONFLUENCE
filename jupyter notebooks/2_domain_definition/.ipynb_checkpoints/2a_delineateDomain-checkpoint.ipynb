    "\n",
    "We've explored the three methods for defining the spatial domain in CONFLUENCE: subsetting an existing geofabric, delineating a lumped watershed, and delineating a new geofabric. Each method has its advantages and is suited to different scenarios. By choosing the appropriate method and configuring it correctly, you can define the spatial domain that best fits your hydrological modeling needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next notebook, we'll look at how to process finalise the process of preparing your spatial domain representation, including optional domain discretisation by dominant geospatial attributes."
