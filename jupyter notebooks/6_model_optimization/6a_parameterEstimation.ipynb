    "\n",
    "This notebook focuses on the crucial task of parameter estimation for hydrological models in CONFLUENCE. Accurate parameter estimation is essential for model performance and reliability in simulating hydrological processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key aspects covered in this notebook include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Overview of model parameters and their significance\n",
    "2. Methods for parameter estimation (e.g., manual calibration, automatic optimization)\n",
    "3. Setting up calibration experiments\n",
    "4. Analyzing calibration results and parameter sensitivity\n",
    "5. Validating the calibrated model\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we explore various techniques for parameter estimation, from simple manual adjustments to sophisticated optimization algorithms. By the end of this notebook, you will have a well-calibrated model ready for scenario analysis, forecasting, or other applications in your hydrological study."
