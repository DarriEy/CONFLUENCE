    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook covers the model-specific preprocessing steps for input data in CONFLUENCE. After completing the model-agnostic preprocessing, we now focus on tailoring our data to the specific requirements of the chosen hydrological model (e.g., SUMMA, HYPE, or MESH).\n",
    "\n",
    "Key aspects covered in this notebook include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Formatting data according to the chosen model's input specifications\n",
    "2. Generating model-specific configuration files\n",
    "3. Preparing initial conditions and parameter files\n",
    "4. Creating forcing data in the required format and resolution\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we ensure that our preprocessed data is compatible with the chosen hydrological model. By the end of this process, you will have a complete set of input files ready for model initialization and simulation."
