    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook focuses on the model-agnostic preprocessing steps for input data in CONFLUENCE. Model-agnostic preprocessing involves tasks that are common across different hydrological models, such as data acquisition, quality control, and initial formatting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key steps covered in this notebook include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Spatial resampling of forcing data to match the model domain\n",
    "2. Calculate zonal statistics for the domain geospatial attributes \n",
    "\n",
    "In this preprocessing stage we ensure that our input data is consistent, complete, and properly formatted before we move on to model-specific preprocessing steps. By the end of this notebook, you will have clean, standardized datasets ready for further model-specific processing."
