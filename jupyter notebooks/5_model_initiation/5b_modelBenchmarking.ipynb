    "# Initializing Hydrological Models in CONFLUENCE\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook guides you through the process of initializing hydrological models within the CONFLUENCE framework. Model initialization is a critical step that sets up the model structure, parameters, and initial conditions for simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key steps covered in this notebook include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Setting up the model structure based on the discretized domain\n",
    "2. Initializing model states and parameters\n",
    "3. Configuring model settings and options\n",
    "4. Performing initial test runs to ensure proper setup\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we focus on initializing the primary model chosen for your project (e.g., SUMMA, VIC, or MESH), but the principles can be applied to other  models as well. By the end of this notebook, your model will be fully initialized and ready to run."
